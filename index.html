                    <p>"Your phone, my life;: or, how did that phone land in your land" is the adventurous story of how the world built and
                        expanded its mobile networks over the past thirty years. </p>
                    <p>The author"s" journey started in the USSR, Ukraine, where she
                        and her , as part of a team, negotiated with the Minister of Telecommunications of a country with virtually no telecom
                        infrastructure. From Kiev, her work took her first to other countries in the former Eastern Block and then to Western
                        Europe, Kosovo, Lebanon, Azerbaijan and Haiti. As CEO, she was in charge of mobile network operations in all these
                        countries, and managed them through periods of political unrest, war, bomb attacks and other serious obstacles.
                    </p>
                    <p> She and her teams have received many awards, ranging from prizes for the best CSR, best branding, and best technology
                        programmes, to recognition from the UN for the work she and her team did for the UN investigation into the assassination
                        of former Lebanese PM Rafiq Hariri. She also received a personal award as Best International Manager whilst working in
                        Azerbaijan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Looking back, she says, "I"m happy our efforts made that people are able to stay in touch, no matter what.</p>
